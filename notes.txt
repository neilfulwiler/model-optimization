% - init the genetic algorithm
% - load the data (the human data, take one set-up)
% - run the genetic algorithm using the objective
%	function test.m

% understand better the topology of the parameter space
% and how its being explored by the genetic algorithm

% using two algorithms in parallel

% first optimize the model on given inputs to the model, 
% trying to find them again

% using the average over a number of participants/trials
% on a single setup

% optimizing kg, c1, c2

% line-search algorithm (don't lose your time)

% the other approach is a systematic approach, 'paving'
% the parameter space and checking each intersection, 
% then running the genetic algorithm at each found local
% minimum

% kg 1<100(0)
% c1 .1<8 (same with c2)


% step1 (confirmation) in competition, what happens
% step2 (complementary) they work together, find local minima
% 	with systematic, then initialize the genetic
% 	algorithm in those areas


% ask Stephane on Friday if I have any questions
% play with systematic algorithm until I get the genetic
% algorithm
